<P>
  After a career in many sectors and working in different countries,
   I have recently settled in the UK and decided to dedicate time to study and develop a career in the tech industry, 
   which is the area that I've always been interested in.

My experience so far has mainly been working in front-end development, 
however I am also interested in developing my skills further in back-end. 
I have a good sense of aesthetics and enjoy making functional and engaging web applications that have a simple, 
clean and distinct design. I have extreme attention to detail and strive for perfection.</P>
